# MiniLD71GBA

This repository contains the source code and binary of a Game Boy Advance port of my [MiniLD71](https://github.com/Pusty/MiniLD71) entry.
The project was meant as a way to play around with the GBA hardware and to have some fun with it.
Besides playing it normally , multiplayer over cable with up to 4 devices is implemented.

*As of now, the ROM has not been tested on real hardware :(*
